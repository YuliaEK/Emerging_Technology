Dear Iresha,
 
I’m writing to invite you to a meeting on 17 August at 15:45 to discuss the  potential of emerging technologies and practices that will benefit Regen Tech and our clients.
 
As Regen Tech encountered with the problems such as:
 
1. Cost of creating of multimedia and visualisation for farmers;
2. Not fully developed automated irrigation and liquid fertilizer systems;
3. Manual data gathering.
 
In order to solve the problems and develop all the processes to decrease the labour cost,  improve their system's capabilities and bring more benefits to farmers, three emerging technologies will be presented for discussion : Drones, IoT/sensor, IoT and Blockchain.
 
The meeting will take place online and will last about 15 mins. The most important topics for discussion include:
 
•	Discuss the features and functions of each emerging technology;
•	The Perspective of implementing emerging technologies for RegenTech and clients;
•	Regulatory responsibilities of each emerging technology.
 
Looking forward to meeting you today.
 
Regards,
Yulia
