Dear Iresha,
 
I’m writing to invite you to a meeting on 19 August at 14:15 to discuss a strategic plan for integrating emerging technologies for Regen Tech.

The meeting will take place online and will last about 15 mins. The most important topics for discussion include:
 
•	What potential threats and opportunities from emerging technologies;
•	How the new technologies will impact existing practices;
•	How do the changes meet the company’s goals;
•	What steps Regen Tech should take to adopt the change.

Looking forward to meeting you today.
 
Regards,
Yulia

## Feedback

After the final presentation, there was some feedback received. Regen Tech required Skynet Research to amend the strategic plan in terms of steps that they have to take in order to adopt emerging technologies.
