# Activity 1

There were used findings about emerging technologies and practices from the academic articles and research papers regarding emerging technologies in the agriculture sector focused on Australian best practices.

The development and convergence of technologies in the world and in the agriculture sector, in particular, is occurring at a faster rate to improve the competitiveness and quality of agricultural products. There are three emerging technologies that could be potentially used by RegenTech.

## Drones
Drones can reduce working hours for farmers and may improve the overall health of their crops, help to save the producer time, resources and allow farmers to use soil enhancers and fertilisers more effectively (DAF of QLD, 2022).
Drone technology is also being used and explored in the livestock industry to check water points, monitor herds, to even assist with livestock movements. Drones can save a producer valuable time and fuel that can be better used elsewhere (ACIL Allen consulting, 2018).
## Zoom
Zoom is the one of the best video communication tools. Zoom easy to use, it has reliable cloud platform, collaboration features such as chat and polls. Zoom can be used across various devices such as desktops, mobile devices and room systems. Zoom is a good tool for delivering educational materials and running the training courses online (Arlo, 2020).
## IoT/Sensor
Using Internet of Things (IoT)   has made a breakthrough in this field with the use of  radio satellite, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based communication, and microcontroller. The technology works in real-time, which feeds it into a cloud-based model to render a detailed picture of how the farm is performing (ACIL Allen consulting, 2018),.

Sensors are devices that detect, measure and report. In the farm environment they can provide data on moisture levels, temperature, plant condition, the location and health of livestock and the presence (or absence) of chemicals and bacteria.

Farmers can get lots of advantages from implementing sensors. The primary function of sensors is that they can detect both nitrogen and moisture levels. Using the information, farmers can farm and determine the right time to fertilizer and water instead of following any predetermined schedule (Dep of Agriculture, 2022).
## IoT and Blockchain
In agriculture, the application of distributed ledgers (Blockchain) is ideally implemented with IoT devices, such as sensors and scanners, which remove the human error component to data entry into the ledger (Dep of Agriculture, 2022). 
IoT monitors the field environment, analyse crop growth, and provide information to the farmer for decision-making. Nevertheless, existing IoT-based agriculture systems have a centralised format of storing data, leaving room for unresolved issues and major concerns such as data security and manipulation. Blockchain's capability of tracking ownership records can be used to solve urgent issues such as food fraud, safety recalls, supply chain inefficiency and food safety. Blockchain’s unique decentralized structure may create a market for premium products with transparency (Haire, 2018).

As farmers are still tracking information on paper, blockchain technology will help generate and securely share data points to create an accountable and traceable system. Vast data points with labels that clarify ownership can be recorded promptly without any alteration (Monash University, 2019).
