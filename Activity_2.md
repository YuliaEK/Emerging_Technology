# Activity 2

## Drones and Audio-Video Collaboration Tool (Zoom)

**Drones** will be used for the visualisation of farms (provide high-resolution imagery and video to show detailed farm development). 

Drones could be used for data collection, soil and field analyse for irrigation application, fertiliser and chemical requirements, and crop spraying with the correct amount of chemicals with increased efficiency and decreased environmental impacts and irrigation.

**Regulatory responsibilities for Drones:**
1.	The use of drones is regulated by Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA).
2.	Restrictions on the use of drones limits their use in Australian agriculture
3.	Agricultural users of drones need to understand their legal liabilities (ACIL Allen consulting, 2018).

**Zoom** will be the main source of delivering training for farmers. Videoconferencing is a great way to bridge the communication gap in remote settings and create an engaging environment.

It offers powerful features for sharing messages, codes, and files among individuals and groups through chat. Zoom offers breakout rooms where an educator can split people into virtual breakout groups. Virtual whiteboards where a presenter can share a whiteboard with the attendees, they can draw, write text, or brainstorm together (Zoom,2022).

**Regulatory responsibilities for Zoom:**
1.	Zoom may discontinue the service or modify the features; 
2.	The provider of the service (organisation/individual) is responsible for the end users’ use of Zoom services;
3.	The provider is responsible for the content sent, transmitted or displayed;
4.	The provider is responsible for compliance will all recording laws (Zoom,2022). 


## IoT/Sensors

IoT devices collect data that can help improve grower decision-making and help to monitor crop/livestock using wireless. (Agriculture Victoria, 2022).

**IoT and Remote Sensing** will be implemented for improving automated irrigation systems with portable wireless sensor networks and decision support methods to remotely measure the environmental parameters in an agriculture field. Radio satellites, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based communication, and microcontroller capture the data such as soil moisture, soil pH, humidity, and temperature(ACIL Allen consulting, 2018). The acquired data from the sensors will be transferred directly to the cloud server by using IoT technology. The farmers will have a user-friendly mobile application to monitor and control their farmland.

**Regulatory responsibilities:**
1. Sensors need to report accurately, consistently and in a timely manner. 
2. There are no uniform standards for sensors.
3. The integrity of cloud-based sensor data can be compromised by viruses or hacking events.
4. Data ownership is a complex issue (ACIL Allen consulting, 2018).


## IoT and Blockchain

Blockchain technology can enhance the performance of security and data transparency. Blockchain technology provides three key benefits: transparency, reducing food fraud and enabling food safety (Monash University, 2019).

Blockchain technology will be used to improve the management system. As RegenTech still uses manual data entry, and as the systems that are in place are largely fragmented, implementing decentralised systems will lead to minimising the errors of data entry and labour cost thus increasing productivity.

IoT can be merged with blockchain to improve the performance of the application in real-time. IoT features and functions were discussed in the IoT section.

**Regulatory responsibilities:**
1. The lack of a consistent global regulatory environment.
2. The technical challenge to connect sensors in IoT with the blockchain (ACIL Allen consulting, 2018).


## Cost of acquisition

**Drones**
1.  Cost of the drone is roughly $3,000
2.  Operational costs (Battery Charging, Training, Maintenance)

The acquisition of drones is supposed to lower the cost of using helicopters and reduce time on image editing.

**Zoom**

1.	The cost of acquisition is around $5000/annually for the business account. 
2.	Operational costs (short training)

Acquisition of Zoom is supposed to make courses more accessible.

**IoT**

1. Cost of acquisition is high. However given the forecasted technology improvements and volume increases, sensor prices are predicted to decrease from around $50 per device. This will significantly increase value for farmers and perhaps prompt further adoption.
2. Operational costs ( Training, Technical Support)

Acquisition of IoT is supposed to lower the cost of fixing waterlogging issues.


**Blockchain**

1. The cost is high due to extremely high-energy requirements
2. Operational costs to consider( Training)

Acquisition of Blockchain is supposed to lower the cost of travelling time from farm to farm and avoid errors of data entry.

## Cost of removal

Drones have different features and functions. If there is any needs to replace the existing drones, Regen Tech will be forced to sell the old versions that might have a price significantly lower compared to today’s price. Skills for using new drones have to be updated with the requirements of the new product.

Internet of Things (IoT) based systems for smart farming is considered to be the backbone of farming. IoT acquisitions going not in a rapid mode, and are still new in the market. If any new technology emerges, it’ll likely be integrated into the existing system. This means that in general, IoT has no specific costs to replace. 

Zoom is easy to replace once there are any new tools emerge. This means that Zoom has no specific costs to replace. 

Blockchain has good potential in terms of food safety and food fraud. Nevertheless, it could be replaced if the producers do not see direct benefits. Before replacing, the company has to find a new way of data collection and storing that will may cause extra costs.
