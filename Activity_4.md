# Activity 4
## Drones
**Opportunities**
Regen Tech will benefit from implementing Drones in terms of lowering the cost of using helicopters to take high-resolution images and videos of the farmlands. Moreover, it will lower the labour cost and workload that the visualisation team has been experiencing.  
**Threats**
Rege Tech has to follow CASA requirements to be allowed use drones. Licensing and operating challenges(safety, trespass, privacy) created by CASA requirements can make operating drones on a larger scale or in remote locations difficult. Regent Tech has to have a certificate to operate with a drone that includes training, compliance, and maintenance. 
## Zoom
**Opportunities**
Delivering online courses for farmers through Zoom will bring benefits to Regen Tech and farmers. Regen Tech has the opportunity to lower the cost of renting a space to deliver its courses. Moreover, the company will have much more farmers to learn the courses online whereas it would be in a classroom, which may potentially lead to getting more clients thus increasing of company’s profit. Farmers won't need to leave their farmlands and learn about Regen Tech solutions at home.
**Threats**
Security concern if educators do not password-protect Regen Tech online courses and there is non-expandable whiteboard.
## IoT/Sensors
**Opportunities**
IoT sensors will help RegenTech to improve their automated irrigation and liquid fertilizer systems and ensure the accurate application of water to a crop, which reduces costs, helps to prevent waterlogging and reduces water waste. 
**Threats**
Some sensors can become unreliable as a result of incorrect settings, thus if sensors fail or use faulty data it will lead to potential harm to business operations and the image of RegenTech in the market. Data ownership is a complex issue, farmers want to own their data but RegenTech has to have access to the raw data for support purposes. As our data will be stored in the cloud it could have cybersecurity problems such as a virus or hacking events.

## Blockchain and IoT
**Opportunities**
Adoption of blockchain technology would minimise the error of data entry, reducing the risk of security of data and increasing efficiency. Only relevant stakeholders (e.g., farmers, Regen Tech, etc.) are owners and only they can add records and verify the contents of the ledger. IoT will monitor the field environment, and analyse crop growth, using blockchain technology all the data will be securely stored. Regen Tech team will reduce time on data gathering and lower the cost of travelling from one farm to another. Data will be up to date. 
**Threats**
Implementing new technology is quite expensive, thus adoption can be limited by farmers. If connectivity is poor sensors will be unable automatically capture and enter data into the distributed ledgers. Blockchain is still in the pilot stage, and there are a number of barriers (technological challenges, scalability, privacy concerns, etc.) that must be overcome for the promised benefits to be realised. 

## Potential changes in planning

Integration of drones will lead to no need to use helicopters to take pictures and videos, and time on editing a large number of images and videos could be reduced due to drones' features to take clear and high-quality images and videos of the entire farmland and showcase all angles of it. The videoconference tool will lead to decreasing expenses on renting a space for running courses and make the course interactive for farmers by using all the features of Zoom.

## Potential changes in automation

Applying IoT/Sensors will enhance existing automated irrigation and liquid fertilizer systems. Sensors are better adapted to changing weather conditions and will give accurate data. Moreover, IoT will bring more features to the farmers  for example IoT can calculate the trajectory very precise and reduce cultivation costs per hectare by around $ 60-70 per season. 
## Potential changes in decision support

Regen Tech won’t need to enter data manually and will save time on preparing visual appealing reports that will be up to date and relevant to the farmers. IoT will collect data from several sources, combines and processes them in real-time and then store, analyse, and visualise the data. 

## Emerging technologies relating to RegenTech's organisational goals 
All the emerging technologies are aimed to improve bottlenecks that Regen Tech encountered within three major business streams. Drones will meet the planning stream goals in terms of no need to use a helicopter for photography and the technology will assist in creating high-resolution assets to use in creating content for farmers that will deliver through Zoom. 

IoT/Sensors will meet the goals of the automation team to improve the existing system of irrigation and fertilisation in terms of reducing any chances of waterlogging that harm the crop. 

Blockchain and IoT are aimed to achieve the goals of decision support stream and deliver real-time meaningful data with no delays to farmers. The technologies will help to reduce the labour cost connected with taking measurements, as the team won't need to go on the farms to collect data. The data will be visualised more appealing by using IoT and secure storage by implementing blockchain technology.

## Steps to implement the changes to achieve the goals
The new concept should be explored through legal requirements and data safety and evaluate all the roadblocks associated with implementing new technologies. This strategy will require feedback from other departments to ensure that it fits with wider organisational goals and that there will not be negative consequences.
There is a need for cost evaluation of acquiring new technologies and staff training. It will be quite expensive to start a new practice of using new technologies but the cost will be reduced by the time when the employees in each three departments will be familiar and competent with the changes. 
The next step will be acquiring emerging technologies and testing them in real farming settings in different weather conditions to find problems and ways to evaluate the concept. It will take around 6 months to test the technology broadly revolves around security, usability, reliability, data integrity, security and performance.
IoT first technology that will be presented because IoT is fast becoming more common in the agriculture sector. Drones will be presented next as they have good potential but due to strict government regulations are limited in use. Blockchain will be the last technology due to its lack of trustworthiness and will need some extra time to educate clients about all the benefits it could bring. 
Based on feedback whether it technical issue or lack of knowledge, Regen Tech will try to fix the issue or change the emerging technology if it doesn’t benefit the clients.
## Conclusion
Skynet Research has provided a complete solution for Regen Tech by integrating Drones, videoconference tool, IoT and Blockchain into each business stream. In addition, it was developed a strategic plan for the company to meet their goals such as decreasing the cost of creating content, making more accessible courses to farmers, developing automated irrigation and liquid fertilizer systems, reduce labour intensity and cost of collecting data.
